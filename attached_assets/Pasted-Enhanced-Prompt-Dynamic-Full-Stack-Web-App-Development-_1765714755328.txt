Enhanced Prompt: Dynamic Full-Stack Web App Development and Integration
You are a Senior Full-Stack Web Developer specializing in modern, high-performance, and high-end web applications. Your expertise spans React/TypeScript (Front-End) and Node.js/Express (Back-End), utilizing a Serverless or Microservices architecture.

Your primary task is to implement and fix a dynamic Google Drive/Sheets integration for an existing, contemporary web application. The application's core data storage must transition from local/mock data to live Google resources.

🎯 Key Integration Parameters & Context
Front-End Framework: React with TypeScript (e.g., using functional components, Hooks, and a state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand).

Back-End Framework: Node.js with Express (or a serverless framework like AWS Lambda/Google Cloud Functions).

Google Services: Must use the official Google APIs Client Library (e.g., googleapis in Node.js) for robust, authenticated access.

Authentication Flow: The back-end must securely handle the connection using a Service Account or a configured OAuth 2.0 flow (e.g., for user-specific access, mention if applicable). For this fix, assume the Back-End has secured access via an API Key and Service Account Credentials (stored securely, not hardcoded).

Dynamic Configuration: The integration must be configured dynamically using the following parameters, which will be passed to the back-end via environment variables or a secure configuration service:

GOOGLE_API_KEY: For basic public access/read operations.

process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID: The target spreadsheet ID for all data entries.

GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID: The parent folder ID for all file/photo uploads.

🛠️ Required Fixes and Implementation Logic
You must implement robust back-end API endpoints and corresponding front-end logic to handle the following functionalities. All data operations (CRUD) must target the specified Google Sheet ID or Drive Folder ID.

1. Office Supply Inventory Management (Google Sheets)
Goal: Fix the "Add Item" functionality.

Logic: Implement a back-end endpoint (POST /inventory/items) that securely writes a new item record (Item-Name, Item-Description, Item-Category, Item-Location, Current-Stock, Item-Unit, Item-Status) to a specific worksheet/tab within the process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID.

Validation: Ensure server-side validation for required fields before writing.

2. Calendar of Activity Management (Google Sheets)
Goal: Fix the "Add New Event/Task" functionality.

Logic: Implement a back-end endpoint (POST /calendar/events) that securely writes a new event record (Event Name, Date, Time, Location, Notes) and new task record (Task Name, Date & Time, Deadline Date & Time, Description) to a different specific worksheet/tab within the process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID.

3. Contact Directory Management (Google Sheets)
Goal: Fix the "Add New Contact" functionality.

Logic: Implement a back-end endpoint (POST /contacts) that securely writes new contact details (Contact Name, Role/Title, Agency, Primary Phone) to a third specific worksheet/tab within the process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID.

4. Document Management System (Google Drive)
Goal: Implement full CRUD for files and folders.

Logic: All operations must target the GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID:15_xiFeXu_vdIe2CYrjGaRCAho2OqhGvo.

CREATE (Files/Folders): Implement endpoints to upload files (single file upload) and create new folders.

READ: Implement an endpoint to list the files and folders within the root folder, returning necessary metadata (ID, Name, MimeType, WebContentLink).

UPDATE: Implement logic to rename files/folders.

DELETE: Implement logic to trash/delete files/folders by ID.

5. Photo Gallery (Google Drive)
Goal: Implement specialized upload and management for images.

Logic: All image uploads must target a designated "Gallery" sub-folder created/verified within the GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID:1O1WlCjMvZ5lVcrOIGNMlBY4ZuQ-zEarg.

CREATE: Implement an efficient back-end endpoint (POST /gallery/upload) to handle:

CREATE: image preview with copy image, download, print option

Bulk Upload: Process multiple image files sent in a single request.

Drag-and-Drop Support: Ensure the front-end components correctly package and send these files for the bulk upload endpoint.

READ: Implement an endpoint to list images in the gallery sub-folder, ensuring retrieval of the thumbnail/web view link for display in the front-end gallery.

💡 Expected Deliverables
Detailed Architecture Outline: A plan for the back-end API structure and how it will interact with Google APIs.

Key Code Snippets: Focus on the critical back-end function for inserting a row into a Google Sheet and the function for uploading a file to Google Drive.

Front-End Interaction Logic: A clear explanation or pseudo-code of how the React components will call the new back-end endpoints, especially for the complex drag-and-drop upload.
